My Open Source Journey ✨

👤 Name: Sarnendu Paul
📅 First Contribution: October 2023
🔧 Tools/Tech Used: Python, C, Java, Git, GitHub, VS Code

🌟 My Experience:
Getting started with open source was both exciting and a bit intimidating, but once I made my first contribution, I realized how welcoming and collaborative the community really is. Through Hacktoberfest, I learned how to use Git and GitHub more effectively, practiced writing clean code, and explored different projects ranging from algorithms to real-world applications. Each pull request boosted my confidence, and I started to enjoy solving issues and collaborating with developers around the world. Open source taught me not just coding, but also teamwork, patience, and the value of continuous learning.

📌 Advice for Beginners:
Don’t wait until you feel “ready” — just start contributing, even with small fixes. Every line of code, every typo fix, and every documentation update counts!
